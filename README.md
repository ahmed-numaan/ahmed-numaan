# Ahmed Numaan


Hello, I'm Ahmed Numaan, currently based in the vibrant city of Karachi, Pakistan.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Karachi, graduating in 2008. As a seasoned Senior Software Engineer working remotely, I specialize in the dynamic realms of publishing web pages and the development of both mobile and web applications.

With a diverse skill set that spans HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery, ES5, ES6, React.js, Node.js, PHP, and Laravel, I bring a wealth of expertise to the table. My proficiency extends to various databases, including MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.

On a personal note, I am happily married and blessed with a son and a daughter. Outside the realm of code, you'll find me immersed in hobbies such as traveling, internet surfing, jogging, swimming, and engaging in calisthenics. At home, my companions include a few hens and a playful cat.

I'm enthusiastic about connecting with fellow professionals, exploring new opportunities, and contributing to innovative projects. Looking forward to engaging in meaningful conversations and collaborations.
